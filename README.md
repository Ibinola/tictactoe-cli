## Tic Tac Toe in JavaScript

This is a command line implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe written in JavaScript. Players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid until one player gets three in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or until the board is full and the game is a tie.

### Getting Started

To play the game, simply run the index.js file in a terminal:

```javascript
node index.js
```

Then follow the on-screen prompts to take turns making moves. The game will continue until a winner is found or the board is full and the game is a tie.
